  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "blog"=>{"title"=>"Active Record Associations", "content"=>"<div><strong><br>1 Why Associations?<br></strong><br></div><div>Why do we need associations between models? Because they make common operations simpler and easier in your code. For example, consider a simple Rails application that includes a model for customers and a model for orders. Each customer can have many orders. Without associations, the model declarations would look like this:<br><br></div><div>class Customer &lt; ActiveRecord::Baseend class Order &lt; ActiveRecord::Baseend</div><div>Now, suppose we wanted to add a new order for an existing customer.
